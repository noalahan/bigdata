# Big Data

This repository contains my project from the [UAL](https://www.arts.ac.uk/) Creative Computing Institute ([CCI](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute)) Big Data course

## Project

**Project Prompt:** Create an automated software-based system which continually polls a web-based API for data and stores large amounts of data, which is processed, analysed and the findings visualised.

I chose to use a weather API to collect and analyse historical weather data with focus on how the data shows global warming.

This information was then visualized by making an interactive website using D3.js.

**Video Presentation:** Quick walkthrough of code and website avaliable [here](https://youtu.be/_AtRaT_nCmU?si=49ANaXzLthoJxRYU&t=2).
